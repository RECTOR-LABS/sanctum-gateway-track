**Progress Tracking**: Update this checklist daily and mark items as complete. This will help maintain momentum and ensure nothing is missed.

**Remember**: It's better to complete fewer items excellently than many items poorly. Focus on core requirements first, then add enhancements.

Bismillah, may Allah grant ease in completing each requirement!
