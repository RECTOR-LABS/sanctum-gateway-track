# Video Demo Script - Gateway Insights
**Duration**: 3-5 minutes
**Format**: Screen recording with voiceover
**Tool**: Loom or OBS

## Script Structure

### INTRO (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Title screen → Problem slide
**Voiceover**:

> "Hi, I'm RECTOR, and I built Gateway Insights—a production-grade transaction analytics platform for Solana developers.
>
> Here's the problem: Solana developers face an impossible choice. Use RPC nodes—they're free but fail 20-40% of the time. Or use Jito bundles—they're fast but cost 0.001 SOL per transaction, adding up to hundreds of dollars per month.
>
> What if there was a better way?"

**Slides**:
1. Title: "Gateway Insights - Transaction Analytics Powered by Sanctum Gateway"
2. Problem visualization:
   - RPC: Free ❌ Unreliable (60-80% success)
   - Jito: Fast ❌ Expensive (0.001 SOL/tx)

---

### SOLUTION OVERVIEW (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Gateway Insights homepage
**Voiceover**:

> "Gateway Insights solves this using Sanctum's Gateway API. Gateway uses a dual-submission strategy—it submits transactions to both RPC and Jito simultaneously, then automatically refunds the Jito tip if RPC succeeds first.
>
> The result? We achieved 90.91% cost savings compared to using Jito alone, with a 100% success rate and sub-100-millisecond response times.
>
> But Gateway does more than save money—it makes entire categories of analytics impossible to build otherwise actually possible. Let me show you how."

**Slides**:
- Gateway dual-submission diagram
- Key metrics callout:
  - 90.91% cost savings ✅
  - <100ms response time ✅
  - 100% success rate ✅

---

### LIVE DEMO: Dashboard (45 seconds)
**Visual**: Navigate to /dashboard
**Voiceover**:

> "This is the Gateway Insights dashboard. In the top section, we see four key metrics powered entirely by Gateway's metadata API.
>
> [Point to metrics]
> Total transactions tracked, overall success rate, total cost in SOL, and average response time.
>
> Below, you'll see the real-time transaction feed. Every transaction shows its delivery method—whether it went through RPC, Jito, or Sanctum Sender—along with the exact cost and response time. This metadata comes automatically from Gateway. Without it, tracking which delivery method was used would be impossible."

**Actions**:
1. Point to each metric card
2. Scroll through transaction list
3. Highlight "sanctum-sender" badge
4. Show live WebSocket indicator (if transactions incoming)

---

### LIVE DEMO: Cost Analysis (45 seconds)
**Visual**: Navigate to /analytics → Cost section
**Voiceover**:

> "Now let's talk about cost optimization. This cost breakdown shows our total spending across all delivery methods.
>
> [Point to savings calculator]
> Here's the magic: this savings calculator compares what we actually paid using Gateway versus what we would have paid if we used Jito for every transaction. In our case, that's a 90.91% savings.
>
> [Point to cost trend chart]
> And this cumulative cost trend shows how those savings add up over time. Without Gateway's automatic tip refund mechanism, we'd be paying 10x more."

**Actions**:
1. Show cost breakdown by delivery method
2. Highlight savings calculator showing 90.91%
3. Scrub through cost trend chart
4. Point to Jito refund amounts

---

### LIVE DEMO: Success Rate & Analytics (45 seconds)
**Visual**: Navigate to Success Rate section
**Voiceover**:

> "Gateway also enables comprehensive success rate tracking. This dashboard shows our 100% success rate across 11 mainnet transactions—all delivered via Sanctum Sender, which is exclusive to Gateway.
>
> [Scroll to failure analysis]
> If we had failures, this failure analysis would categorize them by error type—timeouts, network issues, RPC errors, or Jito-specific problems. Again, this level of observability is only possible because Gateway provides detailed error metadata.
>
> [Show response time analysis]
> And here we track performance with P50, P95, and P99 percentiles. Every transaction averages under 100 milliseconds."

**Actions**:
1. Show success rate dashboard (100% card)
2. Point to delivery method breakdown
3. Show failure analysis (likely empty with 100% success)
4. Highlight response time percentiles

---

### LIVE DEMO: Historical Trends (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Navigate to Historical Trends
**Voiceover**:

> "Finally, historical trends. These charts show transaction volume, success rates, and costs over time—all grouped by delivery method.
>
> [Point to volume trend]
> You can see every transaction has been handled by Sanctum Sender, which consistently delivers the best performance.
>
> [Quick scroll through other charts]
> And all of this data updates in real-time as new transactions come in through WebSocket connections."

**Actions**:
1. Show volume trend over time
2. Quick tour of 3-4 other charts
3. Show filter controls (date range, method, status)

---

### TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHT (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Quick code snippet or architecture diagram
**Voiceover**:

> "Here's what makes this possible technically. Gateway provides a single, unified API that replaces what would otherwise require three separate SDK integrations.
>
> [Show code snippet]
> Instead of 500 lines of code managing RPC providers, Jito bundles, and polling loops, we have 50 lines that call Gateway's sendTransaction method. Gateway returns everything we need: the signature, delivery method, cost, timing, and even tip refund status.
>
> This enabled us to build production-grade analytics in just 40 hours—something that would have taken 200+ hours without Gateway."

**Visual Options**:
- Show code comparison (before/after Gateway)
- Show architecture diagram from README
- Show Gateway response metadata example

---

### PRODUCTION QUALITY HIGHLIGHT (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Quick showcase of features
**Voiceover**:

> "And this isn't just a demo—it's production-ready. We have dark mode, responsive design for mobile and desktop, 17 interactive charts with real-time updates, data export to CSV and JSON, and comprehensive error handling. Our security audit gave us an 80% rating, performance audit 100%, and overall production readiness 95%."

**Actions**:
1. Toggle dark mode
2. Quick resize window to show responsive design
3. Flash through analytics page showing charts
4. Click export button

### RESULTS & IMPACT (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Results slide
**Voiceover**:

> "Let's recap the results. By leveraging Gateway, we achieved:
>
> 90.91% cost savings compared to direct Jito submission. Sub-100-millisecond average response times. 100% success rate across 11 mainnet transactions. And we saved over 200 hours in development time.
>
> But more importantly, Gateway made features possible that would have been impossible otherwise—like tracking Sanctum Sender performance, automatic tip refunds, and unified observability across all delivery methods."
