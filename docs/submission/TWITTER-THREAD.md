### Tweet 1: Hook + Problem
*Character count: ~280*

```
I just shipped Gateway Insights—a production-grade transaction analytics platform that saves Solana devs 90.91% on transaction costs 🚀

But it's not just about savings. It's about making the impossible, possible.

Here's what we built using @sanctumso Gateway 🧵👇

```

**Image**: Dashboard screenshot showing:
- Transaction feed
- Key metrics (90.91% savings highlighted)
- Clean, professional UI
- Dark mode

**Alternative Hook Options**:
- "90.91% cost savings. <100ms response time. 100% success rate. Here's how @sanctumso Gateway made it possible 🧵"
- "We saved 200+ hours building transaction analytics for Solana. Here's the secret weapon: @sanctumso Gateway 🚀"

### Tweet 2: The Problem
*Character count: ~280*

```
The Solana transaction dilemma:

❌ RPC nodes: Free but 60-80% success rate
❌ Jito bundles: Fast but 0.001 SOL/tx (adds up to $$$)

For 1,000 tx/month:
• All Jito = ~$25/month wasted
• Mixed strategy = still expensive
• No observability either way

There had to be a better way...
```

### Tweet 3: The Solution
*Character count: ~280*

```
Enter @sanctumso Gateway 🎯

Gateway uses dual-submission:
✅ Submits to RPC + Jito simultaneously
✅ Refunds Jito tip if RPC succeeds first
✅ Routes to Sanctum Sender (proprietary, fastest)

Result: Best of all worlds automatically

My 11 mainnet tx: 0.001 SOL total vs 0.011 SOL with Jito = 90.91% savings

### Tweet 4: The Tech
*Character count: ~280*

```
But Gateway does more than save money—it makes entire features *impossible to build* without it:

🔓 Access to Sanctum Sender (proprietary)
🔓 Automatic tip refund tracking
🔓 Delivery method attribution
🔓 Unified error categorization

```
Gateway Insights features:

📊 17 interactive charts (volume, costs, success rates)
⚡ Real-time WebSocket updates
💰 Cost breakdown by delivery method
📈 Historical trends & comparative analysis
💾 CSV/JSON export
🎨 Dark mode, responsive, production-ready

All powered by Gateway's metadata API

### Tweet 6: Dev Experience
*Character count: ~280*

```
The dev experience is mind-blowing:

Without Gateway: ~500 LOC, 3 SDKs, manual everything
With Gateway: ~50 LOC, 1 SDK, automatic everything

Saved me 200+ hours of dev time

Instead of building infrastructure, I built features users care about

That's the power of great tools

## Engagement Optimization

### Best Time to Post
- **US East Coast**: 9-11 AM ET or 6-8 PM ET
- **Crypto Twitter**: Often active evenings/weekends
- **Monday-Thursday**: Best engagement days
- **Avoid**: Late Friday, weekends (unless crypto-specific event)

### Engagement Tactics
1. **Pin to profile** after posting
2. **Reply to your own thread** with additional details:
   - Link to GitHub
   - Link to video demo
   - Link to docs
   - Technical details
   - Call for feedback
3. **Tag relevant people** (after thread is live):
   - Sanctum team members

5. **Engage with replies** within first 2 hours

### Hashtag Strategy
**Primary**: #Solana, #Gateway, #Web3
**Secondary**: #Blockchain, #DeFi, #Analytics, #TypeScript
**Avoid**: Too many hashtags (max 3-4 per tweet)
