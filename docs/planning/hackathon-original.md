## Track Description

Sanctum is running a **$10,000 prize pool** for hackathon teams that successfully integrate **Gateway** into their projects during the Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon.

### What is Gateway?

Gateway allows developers to take complete control of their transactions on Solana. From optimizing the transactions based on the current network health to ensuring the transaction has the best chances of landing. With Gateway, developers gain **real-time control, observability, and optimization** over how their transactions are delivered on Solana.

### Key features:

> Save money on Jito bundles. You can send transactions through RPCs and Jito Bundles at the same time. If they land through RPC, we refund the Jito Tip, so you can get the best of both worlds (better delivery + save cost). Jupiter saves hundreds of thousands of $$ a year with this service.

> Save developer time. We have a robust observability suite where you can see every transaction in real time and change parameters without any code redeployment. This means less developer time trying to track down delivery errors and fix them quicker.

> Send transactions with no RPCs required. For teams that don't want to faff around with RPCs, we have Sanctum Sender, the simplest and cheapest way to send transactions on Solana — just plug in our API. We charge 0.0001 SOL per transaction, 10% that of Helius Sender, Nozomi, 0Slot etc.

> For bigger teams: We have a round robin functionality for transaction routing. Plug in all your RPCs and other delivery methods, specify the weights, and we will help you route your transactions to all of these in specified weights/probability. This is very useful for benchmarking and load balancing.

### What We Want from You (Prize Criteria):

We're looking for hackathon projects that meaningfully integrate Gateway and demonstrate real wins:

- Integrate Gateway (calls to `buildGatewayTransaction` + `sendTransaction`)
- Document and tweet how Gateway enabled something otherwise hard or impossible
- Optionally, build additional tooling or UI around it

### Resources:

- [Gateway](https://gateway.sanctum.so/)
- [Documentation](https://gateway.sanctum.so/docs)
